<h1>The Girl with a Pearl Earring</h1>
<p>Come on, let's talk about "The Girl with a Pearl Earring," a piece I owe you a comment on since this morning. Allow me to elaborate a bit more than usual this time. Simply because it's your favorite artwork throughout art history, and out of the billions of pieces you know, you've chosen this one as yours. So, I believe it deserves a bit more time. Additionally, there are some details in the painting I'd like to explore with you.</p>

<p>But to understand the origins of these details, I think it's necessary to put the artist in context. We're in the seventeenth century. The political and religious changes in Europe are brutal. In the Netherlands, it breaks free from the yoke of Spanish Catholicism, which will bring about a very important change in pictorial production. Why? Because in the rest of Europe, the church is the most important patron. Thus, the commissions are made by bishops, and they are made with a very clear theme and purpose: a religious theme with a didactic and instructive objective.</p>

<p>However, Johannes Vermeer, the author of "The Girl with a Pearl Earring," is in Delft, a rich and very prosperous city, especially because it is the hub of spice trade with Asia. There, the Dutch headquarters of the East India Company is located. So, there's a mix of cultures and a richness not found elsewhere. And besides, this makes many people wealthy from trade and creates a very powerful bourgeois class. These will be the patrons who make commissions to artists. This will make the themes completely different.</p>

<p>Realize that we're talking about Vermeer painting at the same time as Caravaggio. Caravaggio, with his drama, his chiaroscuro, his religious themes, and others. And yet, we find Vermeer, who is a genre style called... he doesn't do folk painting. Usually, the protagonist is a woman, normally. As he paints for the bourgeoisie by commission, the woman is a wealthy woman who is trying on jewelry, or who is reading, or who is sleeping. Always doing very ordinary things in a very intimate environment.</p>

<p>The interior, where the light source is always created by the artist himself, since it is a window that he always places on the left side of the work, is a source of natural light. Vermeer's light in this has been studied as very interesting throughout the history of art. The treatment it receives, which is quite sublime, how he manages to let that light enter from the left, illuminating the whole room in a very subtle way. That only Vermeer has achieved.</p>

<p>Moreover, the guy is one of the least prolific artists throughout the history of art. He has very few works, I think about thirty-something. Some have been lost, but let's say, it's a very short production. And he has several reasons. One, he worked by commission, that is, if he has no commissions, the guy does no work. He doesn't have a workshop like Rubens, and I have a bunch of people helping me and I do a thousand productions. The guy has to support eleven children.</p>

<p>Later, the guy dies and leaves brutal debts to his widow. In fact, "The Girl with a Pearl Earring," I don't know if you know, was lost for over two hundred years out there. Because the widow ends up with debts in total that they have to sell all the estate. And among the things she sells, well, her husband's pictorial production. Then, the work is found two hundred years later by an art connoisseur at an auction and he buys it for a song. Quite deteriorated, by the way. There are theories that say he bought it for two florins and others say that, well, about thirty euros in exchange. Well, a trash considering the work that it is.</p>

<p>We're talking about why so little pictorial production. Okay, if the guy paints only by commission, if he has no commissions, he doesn't do any work. He starves to death. So, the guy has to look for those commissions. In this, he has a lot in common with why "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" was made. By painting by commission, the guy has time. He has time and becomes a very meticulous painter who paints slowly, with details, without any hurry. And that is reflected in his works. They are works that transmit a lot of calm, a lot of peace, and a lot of tranquility. A serenity that only Vermeer, being Baroque, could give to the works.</p>

<p>I told you before that women are the protagonists. Sometimes he also paints maids doing their everyday tasks. And in front of all this, suddenly, we come across "The Girl with a Pearl Earring." In front of the folk images of bourgeoisie trying on jewelry, appears this image of this mysterious young woman. The different, the mysterious, what Vermeer had never done before. And you say, "And where did he get this from? Now, who is she?" It's not the question that many people, many art theorists have asked. Well, there are theories that say she is the artist's own eldest daughter, Maria. And there are other theories that say she might be one of his maids.</p>

<p>However, although a model exists, that's clear, in this work it's a "Tronie." And the "Tronie" were very typical of Flemish artists. Let me explain, the "Tronie" served as a presentation card. As a sample. If you live off the commissions made by the bourgeoisie, the merchants, you have to approach the bourgeois of the moment and tell him, "Hey, buddy, I am capable of doing this. You wouldn't want me to paint your wife or your daughter." Then, "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" itself is not a presentation card, a sample of what Vermeer was capable of doing. Actually, it's his resume.</p>

<p>His resume became the greatest exponent of his pictorial work throughout the history of art. Curiously enough. So, "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" was not a work made for others. It was a work made for him and to help him get other more important commissions that were economically beneficial.</p>

<p>If you have the work in front of you, the image of the girl is outlined against a very dark background. It's true that later studies have revealed that the background was not so dark, but with those two hundred years that it was out there, it made the work deteriorate quite a bit. And with recent studies that have been done, it can be seen that in the back, Vermeer indeed painted some kind of green curtain. But she turns towards the viewer, looks at you. That look, that gray look between innocent but complicit, with those luscious lips, those lips that part as if they want to say something. Sensual, innocent at the same time. She has an angelic face, with perfect features.</p>

<p>In the work, light is super important. Realize that it's Vermeer, then the light comes from the left, just like in all his works. Although here we don't see that light point, that window that he always made, it still comes from the same side. And it hits brutally on the left side of the young woman's face. And then it seems to spill over her garments. It's brutal how he does it. It makes us have to think of Caravaggio, as we were talking about earlier, that chiaroscuro. But as I said before, not with that drama, but with another intention. The intention of making our eyes go to the light focus.</p>

<p>There are some details in the work that we would like to reach with you. And if you could see the work while I tell you this, it would be much easier to visualize them. Notice how the collar of the shirt stands out from the rest. I used a very short palette, and to make that bright white, I used lead white. If you notice, the white of the collar reflects on the lower part of her face, under her jaw. There's a small reflection that is none other than the light emitted by the shirt itself. It's brutal, isn't it? This is also a resource that Goya used in the tapestries.</p>

<p>I already told you that I had worked at a Goya exhibition. Well, Goya used this resource in his cartoons for tapestries. Subsequently, "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" is called that because the pearl stands out a lot. It's not the center of the composition. The composition is clearly diagonal, marking a diagonal from the top of the turban to the lower part of the chest. In the center would be the mouth or the white cheek. But the eyes lead us to the pearl.</p>

<p>The pearl is a symbol of wealth and is exaggerated. That is, he paints for the bourgeoisie, so he wants to gain the favor of the bourgeoisie by exaggerating wealth. So, well, it's a way of drawing attention. There isn't really such a big pearl. If we look closely, you can see that in reality they are three brushstrokes with different intensities of white. That lead white we mentioned earlier. There's no hook that makes it hang from the ear. Those three brushstrokes are suspended in the air. Vermeer was doing magic with his brushstrokes.</p>

<p>Look back at her face. Notice that, if you look at the nose, there's no bridge. The part of the nose where the bridge should be merges with the light of the cheek. That is, Vermeer suggests and your brain constructs. Just like with the pearl, which in reality is not an earring, they are three brushstrokes that float under her ear. Well, that's a bit magical, isn't it? I find it brutally, super interesting. And also, in the painting, he manages to reflect all the lighting effect of the painting in the pearl.</p>

<p>And let me explain, let's see if I can, because this concept is a bit more complicated. The upper brushstroke is very intense. There it's capturing the light from the foreground, the one that would enter from that natural light focus on the left. The light from the lower part is divided into two. One is the one reflected by the shirt itself, and the other is more the darkness of the other plane. Then, all the lighting effect that Vermeer prints in the work is reflected in those three brushstrokes. Like the mirrors of Jan van Eyck, in "The Arnolfini Wedding," he also drinks a bit from this artist. It's brutal.</p>

<p>She has a lot of substance, the work, actually. In the turban, the turban is not usual at that time. That is, we return to the influence of Oriental culture due to that spice trade we mentioned earlier. The turban has to make us think of the Ottoman Empire. Well, to make that blue turban, this is a blue called ultramarine blue, and he does it with lapis lazuli. This is very expensive, very expensive, within reach of very few artists. And you say, "Damn, how could he do it?" And someone answers you, "Damn, because in the end he painted for the rich, he painted for people who had a lot of dough." There were people who left from the dough.</p>

<p>This he did simply as a resume, as a sample. Where did he get the money? Where did you get the lapis lazuli? Where did you get that pigment that comes from Afghanistan, no less? I mean, it wasn't easy to get. That he was not a top-tier painter. So, well, that's another of the mysteries of the work.</p>

<p>Women did cover their heads, but not with a turban, but with another type of headgear. So, well, those are curious things that the work has. The lights and shadows are also very curious. The shadows on the face are not really in grays, they are greens. He uses ochres, yellow ochre, vermilion. That is, the palette he uses to paint in this work is really curious.</p>

<p>There's another detail I'd like to tell you about, and it's the last one. In the mouth, dense, juicy, luscious and sensual mouth. Mouth that "The Girl with a Pearl Earring" has. Those lips that make you think that she is going to comment on something, that she is going to tell you something, but that we will never know. And there's the mystery. In the lower lip, there's a technique he made with an oil that only he used. That is, linseed oils were very normal at the time, but he used another type of oil that only he used, and that gave it that nuance, not that shine, that fleshiness. But in the corner of the lip, there's a tiny, minuscule white brushstroke that makes your eyes, unconsciously, go to it.</p>

<p>It was discovered in a restoration, I really don't know if it was in nineteen eighteen or I'm making up the data, I don't know, but not long ago it was seen that that brushstroke existed. And what the artist wanted was that, with that point of light, our subconscious would reach her mouth. Because the important thing is her look and her mouth, because it really seems like she wants to tell us something. And that's the great mystery.</p>

<p>And what a lecture I've given you. I want you to know that I think it's no accident that you like this work so much. It's a work of small size, we've talked about this many times. Enjoy the small things. It's a work that's not so easy to read at a first glance. It seems like a simple portrait, and it's not. It has a lot of play behind it, like you. You have a depth that not everyone reads. Fortunately, I do. But you have a special depth, you have substance behind you, like "The Girl with a Pearl Earring." So it's no wonder it's your favorite work.</p>
